# Dijkstra
Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm calculates the shortest path between two nodes in an undirected graph.

To see this algorithm in action take a look at the Main file.

Graph 1 represents a map of airports in the US where the nodes represent airports and the edges represent flights between them.

Graph 2 is a simple undirected graph.

Graph 3 is a blank template to allow you to test your own graph.
